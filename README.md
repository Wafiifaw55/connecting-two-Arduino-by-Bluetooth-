# connecting-two-Arduino-by-Bluetooth-
this is one of simple project by Arduino, And widely use it in many area like remote controling, automation and IoT project.
we have use in this project two Arduino Uno board with two Bluetooth mudule(HC-05), two LED, two push button switch.
Idea here is one of arduino board is work as a master adn the other as a salve two differentiatet between thim, they connect and send data (0 or 1), 0 mean turn off the LED, and 1 to turn ON LED, user can replace the LED with any electronic component taking into consideration the code, voltage, current, and PWM pulses.
I have share code file for both Master and Salve, also png and fritzing file for schimatec.
I hope younare enjoy and find it easy.
